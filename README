* What it is ?

OCaml-Text is a library for dealing with ``text'', i.e. sequence of
unicode characters, in a convenient way

It supports:

  - character encoding/decoding using iconv
  - manipulation of text as UTF-8 encoded strings
  - localised text functions such as compare, upper, ...
  - human readable regular expression inside patterns

In order to be the compatible with other ocaml library without pain,
OCaml-Text choose to use only regular strings for dealing with text.

* Requirement

OCaml-Text needs ocaml >= 3.11 and libiconv. It require also pcre
bindings for ocaml to have regular expression support.

* Building and installation

To build and install it just type:

  $ ocaml setup.ml -configure
  $ ocaml setup.ml -build
  $ ocaml setup.ml -install

This will install the "text" package (ocamlfind is required), and the
"text.pcre" if compiled with support for pcre.

If you get the development version you must obtain oasis
(http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/).

* Development

The last development version of ocaml-text can always be found in the
darcs repository hosted at darcs.ocamlcore.org:

  $ darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/ocaml-text

local variables:
mode: outline
