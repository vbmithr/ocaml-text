* What it is ?

OCaml-Text is a library for dealing with ``text'', i.e. sequence of
unicode characters, in a convenient way

It supports:

  - character encoding/decoding using iconv
  - manipulation of text as UTF-8 encoded strings
  - localised text functions such as compare, upper, ...

In order to be the compatible with other ocaml library without pain,
OCaml-Text choose to use only regular strings for dealing with text.

* Requirement

OCaml-Text needs only ocaml. It has been written/tested with ocaml 3.11.

* Building and installation

To build and install it just type:

  $ make all
  $ make install

This will install the "text" package (ocamlfind is required).

* Development

The last development version of ocaml-text can always be found in the
darcs repository hosted at darcs.ocamlcore.org:

  $ darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/ocaml-text/ocaml-text

local variables:
mode: outline
